The movements of black pawns are controlled by not very complicated proprietary logic, but the game can give a lot of fun.

The game is a combination of chess and checkers, the goal is to capture the opponent's king or deprive the opponent of the possibility of making a move.
Pawns only move one square. Normal pointer only forward and attack only forward diagonally, king only forward and sideways and the same attack, and the queen moves and attacks in every direction.
The pawn, when it reaches the end of the board, turns into a queen
